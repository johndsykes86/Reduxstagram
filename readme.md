# Reduxstgram

This repo is my version of Reduxstgram, the project that goes along with Wes Bos' Learn Redux [series](https://learnredux.com/). The original repo with project folders is [here](https://github.com/wesbos/Learn-Redux-Starter-Files)

## Getting Started

Clone or download this repo and run `npm install` in the `learn-redux` folder with the `package.json` file. Then open your browser and go to 'localhost:7700'. The app should open.
